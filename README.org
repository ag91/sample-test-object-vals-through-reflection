This repository is an exemplary example for testing a specific
scenario in Scala: sometimes Scala developers end up writing an object
for a class like the following

#+begin_src scala
case class A()
object A {
  val a = "a"
  val b = Some(Right(List(1)))
  val c = None
  val d = Some(Left("left"))

  val all = List(b,c,d)
}
#+end_src

With few values this pattern is possible to manage (although an
enumeration would be better!). However time makes this slowly become:

#+begin_src scala
case class A()
object A {
  val a = "a"
  val b = Some(Right(List(1)))
  val c = None
  val d = Some(Left("left"))
  ...
  val y = None
  val z = Some(Left("someOtherLeft"))

  val all = List(b,c,d,...,y) // Argh! The "z" is missing and nobody noticed!
}
#+end_src

When the list of constants in the companion object becomes humongous
it is easy to miss the addition to the ~all~ constant.

Ideally a test utility should save the day and make sure that all vals
are included in the list. You can find this utility in
~./src/test/scala/example/Utils.scala~.

Running ~sbt test~ you will see the desired test case failing.
